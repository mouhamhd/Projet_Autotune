# Digital Signal Processing project :  Autotune 


This is the GIT folder for the Digital Signal Processing project. We will perform some voice coding operation such as Autotune ðŸŽ™

There are several subfolders in this GIT repo 

```
â”œâ”€â”€ Articles
â”œâ”€â”€ Base_Sound
â”œâ”€â”€ Base_Sound_c
â”œâ”€â”€ Matlab
â”œâ”€â”€ Zybo_DSP_Application
      |â”€â”€ RemoteSystemsTempFiles
      â”œâ”€â”€ SDK.log
      â”œâ”€â”€ Zybo-Z7-10-DMA
      â”œâ”€â”€ Zybo-Z7-10-DMA_bsp
      â”œâ”€â”€ system_wrapper.hdf
      â”œâ”€â”€ system_wrapper_hw_platform_0
â””â”€â”€ launch_project.sh
```


- `Articles` : Some resources useful for the project 
- `Base_Sound` : WAV files to test your processing blocks 
- `Base_Sound_c` : Same files in .c and .h format for C embedding 
- `Matlab` : Matlab skeleton for signal analysis 
- `Zybo_DSP_Application` : Core System On Chip part. The code you will have to write is in `Zybo-Z7-10-DMA` 
- `launch_project.sh` : Bash script to launch the software development kit.
